Sharing experiments
===================

There are several ways to share experiment setups and results with others.

If they also install VSTT then you can simply share the .psydat file,
which contains both the experimental setup and any results.

You can also export experiments in Excel or json format,
which allows experiments and results to be shared, analysed and modified
without requiring the VSTT software to do so.

See :doc:`File formats <../reference/file-formats>` for more information.
