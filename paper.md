VSTT is cross-platform, and uses PyQt for the graphical user interface, and the Psychopy [@Peirce2019] library to construct and execute the experiments.
It is published on the Python Package Index and can be easily installed using pip.
In addition we offer a windows installer for users who may be less familiar with installing Python packages.
